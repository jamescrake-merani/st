My build of simple terminal. Not too different from vanilla

# Main Config Changes

- I've changed the font to JetBrains Mono. You might want to change this to monospace so it just goes off whatever monospace is on your system
- Increased font size for HiDPI displays. This is a really hacky way of getting the text to scale for these displays, and I'm sure there's a better way to scale the text without affecting displays that arent HiDPI. However, I haven't found such method

# Patches Applied

- Alpha
- Scrollback
- Scrollback-mouse
- Font2
